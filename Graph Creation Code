import networkx as nx

# Creating a Graph 
G = nx.Graph() # Right now G is empty

# Add a node
G.add_node(1) 
G.add_nodes_from([2,3]) # You can also add a list of nodes by passing a list argument

# Add edges 
G.add_edge(1,2)

e = (2,3)
G.add_edge(*e) # * unpacks the tuple
G.add_edges_from([(1,2), (1,3)]) # Just like nodes we can add edges from a list
